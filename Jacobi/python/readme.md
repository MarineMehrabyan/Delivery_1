___Implementation of Jacobi's algorithm for solving systems of equations___

___Project Description___

The program consists of several parts, first I implemented the matrix class,
I used a number of matrix class methods to write the overall program. 
We are given 2 text files: input.txt and golden.txt.
Before applying the algorithm I checked the existence and correctness of the input file,
only after that I created a matrix object from the data of the input file.
The program works if there is only 1 matrix in the input file. 
For that matrix I called the Jacobi's method.
and I did a test to understand whether the algorithm works correctly or not.
Your can run the program for the numbers you want by writing the values to 
the write_your_input.txt file :)

___To run the program you must perform the following steps___

1. execute the "make test" command on the command line, 
which will build the necessary files for the program and make a test.

2. execute the "make run" command on the command line, which will run the program

3. then use the "make clean" command on the command line to delete the created files.
