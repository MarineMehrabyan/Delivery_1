___Implementation of Gauss's algorithm for solving systems of equations___

___Project Description___

We are given 2 text files: input.txt and golden.txt.
I created a matrix from the data of the input file.
The program works if there is only 1 matrix in the input file. 
For that matrix I called the gauss method.
and I did a test to understand whether the algorithm works correctly or not.

___To run the program you must perform the following steps___

1. execute the "make" command on the command line, 
which will build the necessary files for the program and make a test.

2. then use the "make clean" command on the command line to delete the created files.
