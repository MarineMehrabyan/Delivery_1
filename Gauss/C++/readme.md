___Implementation of Gauss's algorithm for solving systems of equations___

___Project Description___

The program consists of several parts, first I implemented the matrix class,
I used a number of matrix class methods to write the overall program. 
We are given 2 text files: input.txt and golden.txt.
Before applying the algorithm I checked the existence and correctness of the input file,
only after that I created a matrix object from the data of the input file for all the matrices 
in the file. for those matrices I called the gauss method, which is in another file (gauss.h).
and I did a test to understand whether the algorithm works correctly or not.


___To run the program you must perform the following steps___

1. execute the "make" command on the command line,
which will build the necessary files for the program. 

2. then use the "make clean" command on the command line
to delete the created files.
