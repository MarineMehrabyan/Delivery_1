___Program that will solve a linear equation ___
        
___Project Description___
We are given 2 text files: input.txt and golden.txt 
Before applying the linear function I checked the existence and correctness of the input file
only after that I read data from given input.txt file 
then the linear function is called for those numbers
and I did a test to understand whether the algorithm works correctly or not. 
Your can run the program for the numbers you want by writing the values to 
the write_your_input.txt file :)

___To run the program you must perform the following steps___

1. execute the "make test" command on the command line, 
which will build the necessary files for the program and make a test.

2. execute the "make run" command on the command line, which will run the program

3. then use the "make clean" command on the command line to delete the created files.
