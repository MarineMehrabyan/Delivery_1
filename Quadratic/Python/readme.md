__Program that will solve a quadratic equation and make a test__

___Program that will solve a linear equation___

Project Description We are given 2 text files: input.txt and golden.txt
Before applying the linear function I checked the existence and correctness 
of the input file only after that I read data from given input.txt file then 
the Linear function is called for those numbers and I did a test to understand whether
the algorithm works correctly or not.
Your can run the program for the numbers you want by writing the values to the write_your_input.txt file :)

___To run the program you must perform the following steps___

execute the "make test" command on the command line, which will build the necessary files for the program and make a test.

execute the "make run" command on the command line, which will run the program

then use the "make clean" command on the command line to delete the created files
