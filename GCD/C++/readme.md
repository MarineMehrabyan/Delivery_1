___Calculate the GCD of 2 numbers___

___Project Description___

We are given 2 text files: input.txt and golden.txt
Before applying the GCD function I checked the existence and correctness of the input file
only after that I read data from given input.txt file
then the GCD function is called for those numbers
and I did a test to understand whether the algorithm works correctly or not.

___To run the program you must perform the following steps___

1. execute the "make" command on the command line,
which will build the necessary files for the program. 

2. then use the "make clean" command on the command line
to delete the created files.
